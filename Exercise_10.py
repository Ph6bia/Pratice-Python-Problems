This weekâ€™s exercise is going to be revisiting an old exercise (see Exercise 5), except require the solution in a different way.
Take two lists, say for example these two:
	a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
	b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that are 
common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works on two 
lists of different sizes. Write this using at least one list comprehension.
'''

import random

list_a = random.sample(range(1,50), 20)
list_b = random.sample(range(1,50), 30)
result = [i for i in list_a if i in list_b]
print(result)
